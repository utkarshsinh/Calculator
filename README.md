# Calculator

Created a GUI based simple calculator using the Python Tkinter module, which can perform basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**Here is how our calculator will look,** which is made by using the input field, buttons and for the calculation purpose we will use logic in our code defined in functions, like if you want to add two numbers then behind this there must be a logic for addition purpose, similarly for substraction, multiplication, etc, we have created functions whose task is to perform these operations.
We have an Input Field in which the user input will be shown and the final result of the calculation will be displayed.
